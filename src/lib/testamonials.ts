Came with fries, bread and a little side salad. Very flavourful and authentic Moroccan dish. Canâ€™t wait to come back and try their other dishes."

The restaurant is filled with authentic Moroccan goodies and vibe, there is a blackboard containting all the restaurant's recommended dishes, honestly, you can't go wrong with any of them. We came as a group of International students, some of them Moroccan, they communicated swiftly with the owner, and what we got was a 5 star Moroccan cuisine experience."
